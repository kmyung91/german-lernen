# Database Integration Status

## ✅ Completed (Phases 1-3)

### Phase 1: Data Acquisition & Parsing
- ✅ Created curated word list (39 high-quality words)
- ✅ All words meet strict quality requirements:
  - German word with article (for nouns)
  - English translation
  - German example sentence
  - English example sentence
- ✅ Includes nouns (der/die/das), verbs, and adjectives

### Phase 2: Database Design
- ✅ Created SQLite schema with two tables:
  - `words` table (static dictionary data)
  - `user_progress` table (user learning state)
- ✅ Implemented 2-bucket system (dontKnow/know)
- ✅ Proper indexes for performance

### Phase 3: Data Processing Pipeline
- ✅ Created `scripts/build-initial-db.js`
- ✅ Generated `/assets/german-vocabulary.db`
- ✅ Database successfully created with 39 words

## 🔄 In Progress (Phase 4)

### Phase 4: App Integration
- ✅ Installed expo-sqlite, expo-file-system, expo-asset
- ✅ Created `database.ts` utility module with functions:
  - initDatabase()
  - getNextWord()
  - updateProgress()
  - getBucketCounts()
  - etc.
- ⏳ **NEXT STEP:** Update App.tsx to use database instead of hardcoded data

## 📝 Remaining Work

### App.tsx Changes Needed:

1. **Remove:**
   - AsyncStorage usage
   - Hardcoded sampleWords array
   - Old 3-bucket system (learning/reviewing/mastered)
   - wordStates management

2. **Add:**
   - Database initialization in useEffect
   - Loading state while database initializes
   - Database queries for words
   - Update bucket system to dontKnow/know
   - Database.updateProgress() calls on swipe

3. **Update:**
   - Swipe directions:
     - Left: dontKnow bucket
     - Right: know bucket
     - Up: Remove word (is_removed = true)
   - Stats display to show: dontKnow/know/total
   - Undo functionality to work with database

4. **Keep:**
   - All UI/UX (cards, animations, theme system)
   - Flip animation
   - Swipe gesture handling
   - Design system integration

## Files Created:
- ✅ `/DATABASE_PLAN.md` - Complete implementation plan
- ✅ `/scripts/build-initial-db.js` - Database builder
- ✅ `/assets/german-vocabulary.db` - SQLite database (39 words)
- ✅ `/database.ts` - Database utility module
- ✅ `/App.backup.tsx` - Backup of current App.tsx

## Next Steps:
1. Complete App.tsx refactor to use database
2. Test database integration
3. Verify all functionality works
4. Update UI instructions (Swipe left: Don't Know • Swipe right: Know • Swipe up: Remove)

## Future Enhancements:
- Expand word list with FreeDict data (use `npm run build-freedict` in scripts/)
- Word frequency rankings
- Spaced repetition algorithm
- Statistics dashboard
